These are the prefabs for the DMX via Stream Panel variants of VRSL and a short description of each.

VRSL-DMX-Static-Spotlight - The VRSL Spot Light with DMX support. This is the "Static" variant. This means it will not have the ability to follow a "target". It is recommeneded to use this version of the spotlight as it will have all the same DMX movement functionality as the "Mover" variant, but be signifigantly more performant.

VRSL-DMX-Static-Blinder - The VRSL Blinder with DMX support.

VRSL-DMX-Static-LightBar - The VRSL Light Bar with DMX support.

VRSL-DMX-Static-ParLight - The VRSL Par Light with DMX support.

VRSL-DMX-Static-DiscoBall - The VRSL Disco ball with DMX support. Defaults to sector 39.
